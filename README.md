# QMK Keyboard Layouts

This repository stores my [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) keyboard layouts.

## Naming strategy

The repo will contain multiple different layouts for a single keyboard to allow for experimentation. This is done instead of overwriting a single layout to allow quicker iterations.

To enable this a default naming pattern will be used:

`${keyboard_name}-${layout_name}`

## Inspiration

Having watching various videos from [Ben Vallack](http://benvallack.com/), I have been inspired to try further optimising my keyboard layout to further improve my productivity and reducing wrist strain.
